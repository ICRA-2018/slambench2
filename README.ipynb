    "SLAMBench is a SLAM performance benchmark that combines a framework for quantifying quality-of-result with instrumentation of accuracy, execution time, memory usage and energy consumption. It also include a graphical interface to visualize these information.\n",
    "\n",
    "SLAMBench offers a platform for a broad spectrum of future research in jointly exploring the design space of algorithmic and implementation-level optimisations. It targets desktop, laptop, mobile and embedded platforms. Some of the benchmarks (in particular KFusion) were tested on Ubuntu, OS X and Android (more information about android here [https://github.com/bbodin/slambench-android](https://github.com/bbodin/slambench-android)).\n",
